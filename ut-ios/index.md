# [](#header-1) Introduction

Everyone talks about unit testing. But does everyone knows what it is?

The main aim of unit testing is to make a product viable. It helps to solve some problems like :
- I merge my code and I hope everything's OK
- Someone code this block a long time ago. Can I change it?
- Let's update our librairies and IDE. It should be fine...

On this article, we will focus on the mobile part of Unit Tests. Ad I'm an iOS Developer, I will use Swift and Objective-c for all the examples. But the concepts remain the same for Android Developers
