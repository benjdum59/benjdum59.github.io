      <h2>CI - the basics</h2>
      <h3>The aim and steps for a good Continuous Integration</h3>

    <section>
      <h2>What is Continuous Integration</h2>
      <h3>A way to make code quality!</h3>
      <p>
      	<b>Test</b> and <b>Deploy</b> fastly and continuously your web application</br>
      	Stategies: nightly build, on commit, <s>on demand</s>
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Phase 1</h2>
      <h3>Get the code</h3>
      <p>
		Getting the code every developer has on its IDE. Code should be hosted in a Source Code Management (SCM) like Git, SVN...
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Phase 2</h2>
      <h3>Get the libs</h3>
      <p>
		Project's libraries should not be hosted in SCM because it is not part of source code, it is only tools that the code uses to run perfectly<br/>
		There are many tools to download libraries, depending on the project language
		e.g.: Maven, Composer, Bower, Cocoapods...
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Phase 3</h2>
      <h3>Compilation</h3>
      <p>
		 For languages that compiles code (like Java), this is a part of creating a product. Project must be compiled to be understood by the machine.</br>
		 This is also a kind of a test: the 1st one.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Phase 4</h2>
      <h3>Test, test and test again</h3>
      <p>
		 A project without tests is not qualitative. Developer <b>MUST</b> test the application by writing some Unit Tests (UT) and (for very qualitative projects) User Interface Tests (UIT).<br/>
		 So, this phase runs tests and fails Continuous Integration Process if at least 1 test fails.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Phase 5</h2>
      <h3>Create the product</h3>
      <p>
		At this phase, we know that the project compiles and is qualitative. We can make a product of the project. The product will be deployed later.
		A product should be a single file. e.g.: war, jar, phar, zip, tar.gz, rpm, ipa...
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Phase 6</h2>
      <h3>Deploy</h3>
      <p>
		We have the product. Now, a developer/customer/Product Owner may want to test it. So the product is deployed on a server.
      </p>

      <h2>Release</h2>
      <p>
		Use some parts of CI to create a real product, immuable and made for a production environment.

      <h3>Get the code (CI process)</h3>
      <p>

      <h2>Phase 6</h2>
      <h3>Make the source code immutable</h3>
      <p>
		To be sure we can regenerate the product from the source code, you have to make it immutable using tags in SCM.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Phase 6'</h2>
      <h3>Archive the product</h3>
      <p>
		Save the product and make it accessible for the team in charge of deploying it in a production environment.

      <h2>Where to go from here?</h2>
      <h3>This is the theory</h3>
      <p>You have to adapt the theory on each project, on each language. Web and mobile projects are differents; PHP and Java are different too!</p>
