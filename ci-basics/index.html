      <h1>What is Continuous Integration</h1>
      <h2>A way to make code quality!</h2>
      <p>
      	<b>Test</b> and <b>Deploy</b> fastly and continuously your web application</br>
      	Stategies: nightly build, on commit, <s>on demand</s>

    <web-slide data-transition="moveToLeft">
      <h1>Phase 1</h1>
      <h2>Get the code</h2>
      <p>
		Getting the code every developer has on its IDE. Code should be hosted in a Source Code Management (SCM) like Git, SVN...
      </p>
    </web-slide>
    
    <web-slide data-transition="moveToLeft">
      <h1>Phase 2</h1>
      <h2>Get the libs</h2>
      <p>
		Project's libraries should not be hosted in SCM because it is not part of source code, it is only tools that the code uses to run perfectly<br/>
		There are many tools to download libraries, depending on the project language
		e.g.: Maven, Composer, Bower, Cocoapods...
      </p>
    </web-slide>
    
    <web-slide data-transition="moveToLeft">
      <h1>Phase 3</h1>
      <h2>Compilation</h2>
      <p>
		 For languages that compiles code (like Java), this is a part of creating a product. Project must be compiled to be understood by the machine.</br>
		 This is also a kind of a test: the 1st one.
      </p>
    </web-slide>
    
    <web-slide data-transition="moveToLeft">
      <h1>Phase 4</h1>
      <h2>Test, test and test again</h2>
      <p>
		 A project without tests is not qualitative. Developer <b>MUST</b> test the application by writing some Unit Tests (UT) and (for very qualitative projects) User Interface Tests (UIT).<br/>
		 So, this phase runs tests and fails Continuous Integration Process if at least 1 test fails.
      </p>
    </web-slide>
    
    <web-slide data-transition="moveToLeft">
      <h1>Phase 5</h1>
      <h2>Create the product</h2>
      <p>
		At this phase, we know that the project compiles and is qualitative. We can make a product of the project. The product will be deployed later.
		A product should be a single file. e.g.: war, jar, phar, zip, tar.gz, rpm, ipa...
      </p>
    </web-slide>
    
    <web-slide data-transition="moveToLeft">
      <h1>Phase 6</h1>
      <h2>Deploy</h2>
      <p>
		We have the product. Now, a developer/customer/Product Owner may want to test it. So the product is deployed on a server.

      <p>
		To be sure we can regenerate the product from the source code, you have to make it immutable using tags in SCM.

    <web-slide data-transition="moveToLeft">
      <h1>Phase 6'</h1>
